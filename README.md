Based on the code you shared, there are a few things you could do to make it more secure:

    Use HTTPS instead of HTTP: Using HTTPS instead of HTTP can help secure the communication between the client and the server by encrypting the data that is transmitted.

    Use environment variables for sensitive data: Instead of hardcoding sensitive information like URLs and access tokens, you could use environment variables to store these values. This way, even if someone gains access to your codebase, they won't be able to see these values.

    Use a secure cookie to store the access token: Instead of storing the access token in local storage, you could store it in a secure cookie with the httpOnly and secure flags set. This way, the token can only be accessed by the server and it can't be stolen through cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

    Validate user input: It's always a good practice to validate user input on the client and server side. You could use a library like Joi or Yup to validate the input on the server side and Ant Design's Form component to validate the input on the client side.

    Add rate limiting and throttling: Adding rate limiting and throttling can help prevent brute-force attacks and reduce the impact of DDoS attacks. You could use a library like express-rate-limit to add rate limiting and throttling to your server.

    Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): If security is a top priority for your application, you could consider implementing MFA to add an extra layer of security. You could use a library like passport to implement MFA in your application.

1.=> Validation -done using validator.js

.............................................................................................................................................

2.=>Content Security Policies (CSP)[ it help us to prevent from xss attack] - can do using fronted but that can be bypassed in some browsers.

 .................................................................................................................................................
 
3.=> client-side sanitization[ it help us to prevent from xss attack] - done it in frontend using dompurify but server-side sanitization should also be done.
 
 ..........................................................................................................................................................
 
 4.=>Implementing rate limiting[it prevent from brute force attacker ] -can be done from frontend but doing from server is more secure
 
 ........................................................................................................................................................
 
5.=>  storing token in Httponly cokkie [storing on localstorage may be some security issue because of xss attack ]- done
